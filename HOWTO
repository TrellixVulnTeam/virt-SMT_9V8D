How to run virt-SMT.

1, close interference applications such as mdm (KDE), lightdm (GNOME), etc.
2, use "virt-SMT/scripts/vPair" instead of `virsh vcpupin` to set vCPU's affinity.
3, pin vcpus from different VMs to different hardware threads of the same physical core.
4, virt-SMT must be ran with root permission.

virt-SMT has four components, namely xHalt, xPause, xPair and xFair. xHalt, xFair and xPause are running
in the kernel of host OS, and xPair is running in the user space of host OS.

virt-SMT/kernel: the source codes of xHalt, xPause, xFair.
virt-SMT/src: the source codes of xPair.
